Sum of elevation. For each route segment, the total elevation is calculated as the sum of the differences in elevation of the immediately following points, taking into account only those pairs of points where the height of both is given and the height of the second is greater than the first. The total elevation for the entire route is the sum of the elevation of the segments.



Altitude and geographical coordinates of the highest and lowest points on the route.
